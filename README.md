## üîç Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a scalable and secure WLAN for a company with the following requirements:
- VLAN separation for departments.
- RADIUS-based authentication for secure access.
- Differentiated access control using multiple SSIDs.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- VLANs (10, 20, 30, 40) for traffic segmentation.
- RADIUS Server for authentication.
- DHCP Server for dynamic IP allocation.
- Cisco Switches (3560, 2960) for device configuration.
- Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) for wireless access management.

## üèóÔ∏è Network Design
- **VLANs**:
  - VLAN 10: Management (10.10.10.0/24)
  - VLAN 20: HR Department (10.10.20.0/24)
  - VLAN 30: IT Department (10.10.30.0/24)
  - VLAN 40: Trainees (10.10.40.0/24)

- **Connections**:
  - Trunk links between core switch, AP switch, and server switch.
  - Access links for individual departments and servers.

- **Security**:
  - RADIUS for HR and IT authentication.
  - WPA2-PSK for trainees.
